# EV Charging Station Simulator (Python · OCPP 1.6J)

A Python-based **EV charging station swarm simulator** using **OCPP 1.6 JSON**, `asyncio`, and `websockets`.

It can simulate tens or hundreds of **virtual EV charging stations**, all connecting to a CSMS (Charging Station Management System) over WebSocket – perfect for **load testing**, **feature testing**, and **development** of OCPP backends.

The project includes:

- A **mock CSMS server** (OCPP 1.6J backend)  
- A **simulator engine** for virtual stations  
- A **controller API** with a **modern web dashboard** to scale and control the swarm in real time  

For a consolidated, end-to-end guide covering setup, architecture, API, UI, logging, the policy engine, and tests, see the complete documentation: [COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md](COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md)


## Features

### Core simulation
- Simulates any number of charging stations: `PY-SIM-0001`, `PY-SIM-0002`, …
- Each station behaves like a real OCPP 1.6J charge point:
  - `BootNotification`
  - `StatusNotification`
  - Periodic `Heartbeat`
  - Automatic charging sessions:
    - `Authorize`
    - `StartTransaction`
    - `MeterValues`
    - `StopTransaction`

### Mock CSMS (backend)
- Included `csms_server.py` acts as a minimal OCPP 1.6J backend:
  - Accepts all core messages from stations
  - Responds with valid OCPP dataclass payloads
  - Runs locally on `ws://localhost:9000/ocpp/<station_id>`

### Profiles (behavior presets)
Configurable station behaviors via `profiles.py`:

- `default` – balanced, normal behavior  
- `busy` – frequent sessions, higher energy increments  
- `idle` – rare sessions, long idle periods  
- `no-transactions` – stays online, no sessions  
- `flaky` – sometimes goes offline  

Each profile controls:

- Heartbeat interval  
- Idle time between sessions  
- Meter sample intervals  
- Energy increments  
- Offline probability and duration  
- ID tags used for authorization  

### Smart Charging
Stations make intelligent decisions based on:

- **`charge_if_price_below`** (float, e.g., 25.0) – Only charge if current price is below this threshold
- **`max_energy_kwh`** (float, e.g., 30.0) – Maximum energy per charging session; stops when limit reached
- **`allow_peak`** (bool) – Whether to charge during peak hours (8am–6pm)
- **Peak hour behavior** – If allowed during peak, charging rate is reduced by 50% (slower charging when expensive)

Example: An "idle" profile with `charge_if_price_below=18` won't start charging if the price is $19/kWh. A "busy" profile with `allow_peak=True` and `max_energy_kwh=40` will charge slower during peak hours but cap total delivery at 40kWh.

### Controller API + Dashboard UI
- REST API:
  - `GET /stations`
  - `POST /stations/scale`
  - `POST /stations/start`
  - `POST /stations/stop`
  - `GET /metrics` – Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Modern web dashboard served at `/`:
  - Live stats (total stations, running, profile mix)
  - Swarm scaling controls
  - Single station start/stop
  - Stations table with live status updates
- Prometheus metrics on port 9100
  - `GET http://localhost:9100/metrics`

- Choose a profile
- Scale swarm
- Start/stop individual stations



## CLI-Only Usage

### Run a single station
```bash
python station.py
```

### Run many stations
```bash
python run_many.py --csms-url ws://localhost:9000/ocpp --count 50
```



## Smart Charging Policy Engine

The simulator includes a **pure, testable policy engine** for evaluating charging decisions. This centralizes all smart charging logic into a reusable `evaluate_charging_policy()` function that can be tested, extended, and integrated into other systems.

### What is the Policy Engine?

A **pure function** (no side effects, no external state) that determines whether a station should:
- **`charge`** – start or continue charging
- **`wait`** – hold off charging until conditions improve
- **`pause`** – stop charging (energy cap or constraint violation)

### How It Works

The function evaluates three constraints in order:

1. **Energy Cap** – If the station has delivered ≥ `max_energy_kwh`, return `"pause"`
2. **Price Constraint** – If `current_price > charge_if_price_below`, return `"wait"`
3. **Peak Hours** – If `hour in peak_hours` and `allow_peak_hours=False`, return `"wait"`
4. **Otherwise** – return `"charge"`

### Function Signature

```python
from charging_policy import evaluate_charging_policy

result = evaluate_charging_policy(
    station_state={
        "energy_dispensed": 15.0,      # kWh delivered this session
        "charging": True,               # actively charging?
        "session_active": True          # transaction open?
    },
    profile={
        "charge_if_price_below": 20.0,  # price threshold
        "max_energy_kwh": 30.0,         # session max energy
        "allow_peak_hours": False,      # allow peak charging?
        "peak_hours": [18, 19, 20]      # peak hours list
    },
    env={
        "current_price": 18.50,         # current market price
        "hour": 14                      # current hour (0-23)
    }
)

# Returns: {"action": "charge", "reason": "Conditions OK"}
```

### Return Value

Always returns a dict:
```python
{
    "action": "charge" | "wait" | "pause",
    "reason": "Human-readable explanation"
}
```

Example reasons:
- `"Conditions OK"` → Ready to charge
- `"Energy cap reached (15.0/20.0 kWh)"` → Session energy limit exceeded
- `"Price too high (₹24.50 > ₹20.00)"` → Price above threshold
- `"Peak hour block (hour 19)"` → Peak hours + peak disabled

### Usage in Stations

The engine is integrated into [station.py](station.py):

**Before Starting a Transaction:**
```python
policy_decision = evaluate_charging_policy(station_state, profile, env)
if policy_decision["action"] != "charge":
    cp.log(f"{policy_decision['reason']} — waiting")
    await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Retry later
    continue
```

**During Meter Value Loop:**
```python
meter_decision = evaluate_meter_value_decision(
    station_state, profile, env, 
    current_energy_wh=15000, 
    max_energy_wh=30000
)
if meter_decision["action"] == "stop":
    cp.log(f"{meter_decision['reason']} — stopping")
    break  # Exit charging loop
```

### Key Features

✅ **Pure Function** – No side effects, no logging, no state mutation  
✅ **Testable** – 24 unit tests covering all decision paths  
✅ **Extensible** – Add new constraints without modifying existing logic  
✅ **Clear Return Values** – Always returns action + human-readable reason  
✅ **No Coupling** – Logging, state updates handled by caller  

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest test_charging_policy.py -v
```

Test coverage includes:
- Energy cap reached / exceeded
- Price thresholds (above, below, at threshold)
- Peak hour blocking (single and multiple peak hours)
- Decision priority (cap > price > peak > charge)
- Edge cases (zero energy, high caps, midnight, late evening)
- Meter value loop decisions
- Return value structure validation

All **24 tests pass** in < 0.05 seconds.

### Future Extensions

The policy engine is designed for expansion:

- **Ramping**: Reduce charge rate based on constraints (not just stop/wait)
- **Grid Awareness**: Consider grid load / frequency as constraint
- **Charging Priorities**: Queue stations during peak hours
- **Dynamic Pricing**: React to real-time price changes
- **Demand Response**: Respond to grid signals
- **Carbon Intensity**: Factor in renewable energy availability

Example future signature:
```python
result = evaluate_charging_policy(
    station_state=...,
    profile=...,
    env={
        "current_price": 18.50,
        "hour": 14,
        "grid_load": 0.85,          # New: 0-1 load factor
        "carbon_intensity": 150,    # New: gCO2/kWh
        "demand_response": False    # New: grid event active?
    }
)
# New actions: "ramp_down", "defer", "flexible_wait"
```

### Code Location

- **Policy Engine**: [charging_policy.py](charging_policy.py) (120 lines)
- **Station Integration**: [station.py](station.py) (updated with policy calls)
- **Unit Tests**: [test_charging_policy.py](test_charging_policy.py) (300+ lines, 24 tests)

### Design Philosophy

> "A charging decision is a pure function of current state, policy, and environment. Centralizing this logic enables testing, reuse, and evolution without affecting station behavior."

This separates **policy evaluation** (pure, testable) from **policy execution** (stateful, async), making the system more maintainable and flexible.

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/history/{station_id}` – recent logs + energy snapshots for a station
- `GET /api/v1/sessions` – list past charging sessions (optional query: `station_id`, `limit`)



## Dashboard UI

The **interactive web dashboard** at `http://localhost:8000/` provides real-time control and monitoring:

### **Stats Row**
- **Total Stations** – number of simulated stations created
- **Running** – currently active stations
- **Total Energy** – cumulative kWh delivered across all sessions
- **Total Earnings** – revenue at current price × energy delivered

### **Scaling Controls**
- Set target station count (0-1000+)
- Choose profile: `default`, `busy`, `idle`, `no-transactions`, `flaky`
- Click **"Apply scaling"** to adjust swarm

### **Single Station Control**
- Enter station ID (e.g., `PY-SIM-0099`)
- Choose profile
- **Start** or **Stop** individual stations

### **Price Control**
- **Current Price Display** (₹/kWh)
- **+/−** buttons to adjust (±1 per click)
- **Reset** to default (₹20)
- **Applies immediately** to all active stations' smart charging decisions

### **Stations Table** (Real-time Updates)
Each row shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Station ID** | Unique identifier (PY-SIM-XXXX) |
| **Profile** | Selected behavior preset |
| **Status** | `online` (green) or `stopped` (red) |
| **Usage (kW)** | Current power draw |
| **Energy (kWh)** | Total delivered this session |
| **Smart Charging** | Progress bar + energy cap + price threshold + peak settings |
| **Actions** | Start/Stop button |

### **Smart Charging Column Details**
Shows three pieces of info:
1. **Progress Bar** – fills as energy approaches max cap
2. **Energy Stats** – current/max in kWh (e.g., `12.5/20 kWh`)
3. **Constraints** – price threshold + peak charging permission
   - `Price: ₹18 ✓ Peak` = will charge if price ≤ ₹18, peak allowed
   - `Price: ₹20 ✗ No Peak` = will charge if price ≤ ₹20, skips peak hours

### **Activity Log Viewer** ✨
Each station has a collapsible **"📋 Logs"** button in the Actions column:

1. **Click "📋 Logs"** to expand the log panel below the station row
2. **View recent events** including:
   - `[12:05:32] BootNotification sent`
   - `[12:06:01] Authorization successful - ABC123`
   - `[12:06:02] Charging started (price: ₹18.50)`
   - `[12:09:10] Price too high (₹24.00) — waiting`
   - `[12:10:05] Peak hours (6–9pm) and peak disabled — waiting`
   - `[12:14:12] Energy cap reached (30 kWh) — stopping`
   - `[12:14:13] Charging stopped (30.00 kWh delivered)`
3. **Most recent logs first** – newest events at top
4. **Smart caching** – logs cache after first fetch for instant re-display
5. **Click again to collapse** – or click the ✕ close button

The log viewer displays **up to 50 recent entries** per station, showing all critical OCPP events and smart charging decisions in real-time.

### **Real-time Updates**
- All stats and table refresh every **5 seconds**
- Energy and usage values update as stations charge
- Price changes affect new transactions immediately
- Running count updates as stations start/stop

### **Example Usage Flow**
```
1. Scale to 10 stations with "idle" profile
2. Watch them online in the table
3. Increase price to ₹25 → idle stations refuse to charge (threshold ₹18)
4. Decrease price to ₹15 → idle stations start charging
5. Watch energy caps: each capped at 20 kWh
6. Monitor Total Energy and Earnings in stats row
```
